# DL for Network Traffic and Cybersecurity Analysis

This project aims to develop an effective anomaly detection system using deep learning techniques to identify malicious patterns in network traffic. Network security threats continue to evolve in sophistication, making traditional signature-based detection methods insufficient.

By leveraging unsupervised deep learning approaches, we can potentially identify novel attack patterns without relying on labeled examples of every possible attack vector. This research is particularly relevant given the increasing frequency and impact of cyberattacks on critical infrastructure.
